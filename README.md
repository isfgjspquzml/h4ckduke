Group hackathon project

inTouch is a social application to remind yourself to keep in contact with friends or acquaintances. 
When added to your inbox, contacts can be archived or be added to a reminder list.

Capabilities include searching for contacts, contact tags, names, and other information provide on the profile page either through manually inputting the information or through an API that converts pictures of business cards to contact information and sending it to the server to be downloaded onto your device.
